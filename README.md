# SublimeText3Settings

My Sublime Text 3 settings for easy sharing between machines

To Use:
1. On computer 1 with all the settings you want, push the files in Users/youruser/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\  3/Packages/User to this repo

2. On computer 2, delete the content of the above User folder. Clone in this repo to the same location. Restart Sublime Text 3.
